- Made a function to find auto generated doc ID from firebase. Surprised there isn't an easier way to do this, honestly.

- Setup very basic boards page to view data imported from firebase
- Setup form to add boards/notes to firebase. 
- This is all authenticated and secure. 

- Need to add a way for user to update boards/notes
- Users should be able to add as many notes to a board as they want. 
- Users should be able to drag and drop notes to other boards.
- Make a 'board' component to present boards on /boards page. 
- Add a example of the board we're making on /create-board beside the form
- Obviously UI styling, etc once functionality is complete
-
